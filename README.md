The data file is part of an IMDB-based movie database derivative.

Instructions
-------------  

1. Write a program that parses the file and outputs a list of movies with their years.   
2. Filter out all movies that are less than 70 minutes long.   
3. Filter out movies whose primary genre listing is animation.   

Bonus
------  
1. Try to build a system that can reliably detect and filter out foreign language (i.e. non-English) movies.
